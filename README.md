# Citi Bike Analytics - Tableau



The task in this project was to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report. The data aggregation was done in Excel and SQL. Then the exploration was done using Tableau. We were to explore trends in bike usage in the various cities.
